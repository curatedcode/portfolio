				<p>
					My programming journey began by creating games on Roblox, which
					sparked my curiosity into this world. As I kept going down this rabbit
					hole, my path became more web focued, where I discovered new spaces to
					bring my ideas to life.
				</p>
				<p>
					Right now, my main goal is to always learn more and have fun playing
					around with all the cool new tech that keeps coming out. I love
					discovering new things and the world wide web is the gift that keeps
					on giving.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not at the computer, I enjoy hanging out with my family,
					playing with two my dogs, or trying to improve my terrible chess
					skills.
