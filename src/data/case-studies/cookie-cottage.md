## Overview & Challenge

Cookie Cottage had a functional but outdated digital presence that wasn't effectively showcasing their unique offering of baking and cooking lessons for both adults and children. The original website utilized a template-based design with an inconsistent visual language, cluttered information architecture, and poor mobile responsiveness—all contributing to user frustration and high bounce rates.

## Problem Statement

Through heuristic evaluation and user interviews, I identified three critical issues to address:

1. **Confusing Navigation Structure:** Users struggled to decipher the main sections of the website, leading to high bounce rates.
2. **Poor Visual Hierarchy:** Critical information about class schedules, pricing, and baking services was buried beneath unfocused content.
3. **Inefficient Flow:** The call-to-actions were not present in a prominent location, causing users to abandon the process prematurely.

## Design Solution

### Information Architecture & User Flow

I reorganized the site structure around two clear baking services and classes. This segmentation allowed for targeted content while maintaining a cohesive experience. The navigation was simplified to three essential categories with descriptive labels to improve findability.

### Visual Design System

For the redesign, I developed a warm, approachable color palette anchored by a rose pin that evokes baking and creates emotional connection, complemented by a secondary chestnut for visual balance and accent elements. I selected Caveat-cursive for headings to bring a playful tone while pairing it with the more professional Poppins for body text—enhancing readability while maintaining the brand's friendly personality.

### Responsive Implementation

I employed a mobile-first approach with a fluid grid system and flexible components that adapt seamlessly across devices. Class cards transform from horizontal layouts on desktop to stacked configurations on mobile, preserving all critical decision-making information regardless of device.

### Accessibility Considerations

I improved the site's accessibility by implementing proper heading structure, ensuring color contrast ratios exceeded WCAG AA standards, and adding descriptive alt text for all instructional images.

## Expected Outcomes

The redesigned Cookie Cottage website now delivers:

1. A reduction in navigation steps to complete a booking/catering process
2. Clear visual distinction between class types while maintaining brand cohesion
3. Improved legibility and information scanning through thoughtful typography hierarchy

By balancing aesthetic improvements with strategic UX enhancements, the new design not only modernizes Cookie Cottage's digital presence but transforms it into a powerful marketing and conversion tool that accurately reflects the joyful, educational, and delicious experiences they offer.
