## Overview

When I first encountered the Practical Car website, I immediately recognized an opportunity to transform a functional but outdated car rental platform into a seamless, user-centered experience. The original site suffered from an overwhelming interface with a cluttered navigation system, inconsistent visual language, and a booking process that created unnecessary friction for users.

## Problem Statement

After conducting a thorough analysis, I identified three critical issues that needed to be addressed:

1. **Complex Information Architecture**: The original site buried essential information under multiple layers, with car categories, locations, and pricing scattered across different sections.

2. **Visual Inconsistency**: Lack of a cohesive design system resulted in outdated typography, color usage, and component styling that diminished brand recognition and user trust.

3. **Inefficient Avalibaility Flow**: The car selection process was small and unappealing to users, leading to a higher abandonment rate.

## Design Solution

### Streamlined Information Architecture

I reorganized the site structure around user goals rather than company departments. By implementing a task-based navigation with clear wayfinding, I reduced the primary navigation options to 5, focusing on high-priority actions like "Find a Car," "Location," and "FAQ."

### Unified Visual System

I developed a comprehensive design system that improved Practical Car's brand identity while introducing a more sophisticated visual hierarchy. I selected a primary typeface (Montserrat) for headings paired with a highly readable secondary font (Open Sans) for body text, improving legibility across devices.

The color palette was refined using a signature blue as an accent rather than a dominant element, complemented by neutral tones that create breathing room and direct attention to critical UI elements. This approach reduced visual noise while maintaining brand recognition.

### Reimagined Availability Experience

The most substantial transformation came from redesigning the availability flow. I implemented a quick two-stage process with real-time feedback:

1. **Location & Date Selection**: Combined with an interactive map interface
2. **Vehicle Selection**: Featuring filterable options with clear comparison capabilities

By incorporating contextual information and progressive disclosure principles, I reduced the required form fields and implemented inline validation to prevent errors before submission.

## Responsive Implementation

I employed a mobile-first approach, designing core interactions for touch interfaces before scaling up to larger viewports. This ensured that the 70% of users accessing the site via mobile devices would have an optimized experience, with careful attention to tap target sizes and thumb-friendly navigation placement.

## Outcome

This redesign demonstrates how thoughtful UX principles can transform a functional but outdated digital experience into an intuitive, efficient service that aligns with both user needs and business objectives.
